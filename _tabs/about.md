# Hello, World!


I’m a **CS undergrad** in my **sophomore** year with a passion for hands-on engineering, spacecraft technology and building impactful solutions.

---

### Why this blog exists

This blog is my personal **"mission log"** where I hope to:
- Track things I’m building, breaking and (hopefully) fixing
- Dump cool stuff I learn before I forget it
- Stay accountable and actually *finish* some of the projects I start
- Share ideas and late night rabbit holes I fall into

---

### Me

Over time, I’ve dabbled in:
- **Flutter App Dev**
- **Python** + GUI tools like `customtkinter`, `PyQt/PySide6`
- **Computer Vision** with YOLO models and OpenCV
- Building **REST APIs** with FastAPI.
- **ML**-ish things like messing with **RAG** pipelines, scraping websites (ethically) or fine-tuning **local LLMs**.
- Playing around with **ROS**, **RTOS** and low-level embedded programming to build robots that sometimes work and sometimes just whine due to low PWM frequency.

I also love cosplaying as a sysadmin when I SSH into lab computers or my **Raspberry Pi**.

Some quirks:
- Can’t stick to one domain.
- Obsessed about **spacecraft**, **rovers** and the hardware that makes them tick.
- Love talking to machines via UART, REST API or just sheer willpower.
- Debugging is my toxic trait. I will *not* sleep until it compiles.
- Mild OCD. Moderate caffeine dependence. Severe case of “one last tweak”.
