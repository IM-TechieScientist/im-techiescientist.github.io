# What I'm doing now

Iâ€™m spending my summer break tinkering, debugging and pushing myself to build cooler stuff than I did last semester.

---

### Currently tinkering with:

- **Embedded C** and slowly transitioning to **ESP-IDF**
- Diving into **FreeRTOS**, **PWM**, **UART**, **I2C**, and hopefully moving on to **Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and TCP** stacks on the ESP32
- Building a **differential-drive robot** using an ESP32 + L298N and getting it to play nice with **ROS2**
- Hooking up **optical speed sensors** (LM393 based Optocoupler) and visualizing data with **Rviz**
- Exploring the world of **ROS2** and learning about nodes and topics.

---

### On the side:

- Playing with **YOLO models** and some light **computer vision**
- Working with **MCPs**, **RAG pipelines**, and **local LLMs**
- Planning to learn some backend tech stacks like **Go**, **PostgreSQL** and **Redis**

---

### Also noodling with:

- This blog! Built with **Jekyll** and running on **GitHub Pages**
- Cleaning up my notes and turning rabbit holes into hopefully readable posts

---

The list is probably too ambitious, but what's the harm in trying anyway?
